# empathy-ontology
This repository presents an ontology defining the concept we call "computational empathy". This regards a herarchy of sub-concepts for understanding perceptions of empathy in computational systems. In order to enable interoperability with a wide range of knowledge-based systems, the ontology is implemented in Web Ontology Language (OWL).
